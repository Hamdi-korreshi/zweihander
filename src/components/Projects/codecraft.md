## Overview
Codecraft was a capstone project that was made to translate between two different programming languages. For example, C++ to Java using the ChatGPT 3.5 API. It had a history feature, translations with a full working Web IDE, profile, full 2FA OTP implemented by my awesome backend team. This project was interesting because it was my first time being a Project Manager and leading a team this big as well as working with a wed app so extensively. This project allowed me to learn many things such as the JS ecosystem React vs others, frontend and backend, as well as hosting and testing. 

## My Work
Leading the team was a task that I was already familiar with but this was a new spin. All my other projects were split up enough to the point where nobody really interfered with each other. However, due to the nature of the web app, there was many merge errors and stepping on toes requiring me to take extra time for GitHub PR reviews. On top of that there is also the managing ticket aspect and handling problems that arose between members. As for my technical work, I laid out the frame work of the backend by working closely with my backend teammate, worked on the frontend for UI components (NavBar, homepage, signin, etc.) and worked on the deployment of the app on DigitalOcean (it is now down since it required too much credits). 

## Highlights
- Full 2FA
- Translations and history features
